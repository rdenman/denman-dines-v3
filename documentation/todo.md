# TODOs

Items that I want to get done to enhance the site.

## Picture Cropping

Add ability to crop images to choose how they'll display on the site.

## Picture Previews

When adding pictures in the recipe editor, I want some sort of preview how it'll look.

## Fix Number Inputs

Seems like the number input has a mind of its own. It might be incrementing/decrementing when
a user scrolls, causing the number to change.
